@article{Richardson2003,
abstract = {Epidemiologic studies routinely suffer from bias due to exposure measurement error. In this paper, the authors examine the effect of measurement error when the exposure variable of interest is constrained by a lower limit. This is an important consideration, since often in epidemiologic studies an exposure variable is constrained by a lower limit such as zero or a nonzero detection limit. In this paper, attenuation of exposure-disease associations is defined within the framework of a classical model of uncorrelated additive error. Then, the special case of nonlinearity due to the effect of a lower threshold is examined. A general model is developed to characterize the effect of random measurement error when there is a lower threshold for recorded values. Findings are illustrated under the assumption that the true exposure follows the lognormal and gamma distributions. The authors show that the direction and magnitude of bias in estimated exposure-response associations depends on the population distribution of the exposure, the magnitude of the recording threshold, the value assigned to below-threshold measurement results, and the variance in the measured exposure due to random measurement error.},

@article{Jolliffe2016,
abstract = {Large datasets are increasingly common and are often difficult to interpret. Principal component analysis (PCA) is a technique for reducing the dimensionality of such datasets, increasing interpretability but at the same time minimizing information loss. It does so by creating new uncorrelated variables that successively maximize variance. Finding such new variables, the principal components, reduces to solving an eigenvalue/eigenvector problem, and the new variables are defined by the dataset at hand, not a priori, hence making PCA an adaptive data analysis technique. It is adaptive in another sense too, since variants of the technique have been developed that are tailored to various different data types and structures. This article will begin by introducing the basic ideas of PCA, discussing what it can and cannot do. It will then describe some variants of PCA and their application.},
