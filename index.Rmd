# Introduction

exposomeShiny is a data analysis toolbox with the following features:

+ Data handling: imputation, LOD, transformation, ...
+ Exposome characterization
+ Exposome-wide association analysis
+ Multivariate association
+ Omic data integration
+ Post-omic data analysis: CTD database

To do so, exposomeShiny relies on previously existent Bioconductor packages (rexposome, omicRexposome and CTDquerier), it uses them in a seamless way so the final user of exposomShiny can perform the same studies that would conduct using the Bioconductor packages but without writing a single line of code.
