All the required flowcharts will be detailed with a box flowchart as well as screenshots of exposomeShiny in order to provide extra guidance if needed. 5.1.1 LOD imputation Input the exposures, description and phenotypes files and load them into the application. This files have to be provided as csv or txt, there is a selector on the UI to select the type of separation used, it can be either commas, semicolons or tabs/spaces. Excel files or R objects are not supported as inputs. Once the tables are read two new main elements will appear, 1) the option to explore the inputted table, using a selector of the table and a button to trigger the visualization; and 2) six input fields will appear on the right side of the file browsers, they are to select the following parameters: Column name in the description file that contains the exposures Column name in the description file that contains the families Column name in the exposures file that contains the ids Column name in the phenotypes file that contains the ids The treshold of to select between continuous or factor exposures. More than this number of unique items will be considered as continuous The encoding to search for limit of detection (LOD) missings. It can be either a number (example: -1) or a string (example: LOD). This is illustrated on the following figure. Once the fields are completed, please press the Validate selections button in order to check if all the parameters allow for a successful load of the exposome dataset, if not, a pop-up will be prompted to the user. In the case that everything is correct, the UI will be updated and a button that reads Load selected data to analyze it will appear, by clicking this button the dataset will be loaded and the analysis can begin. The input fields are still visible past this point for the case that the user wants to load a new dataset into the application without restarting it. If exposomeShiny detects LODs (limit of detection) on the exposures file, it will prompt the table with the exposures with LOD and double clicking on the desired cell will enable edit mode to input the instrument LOD. Theres also the option of selecting Random imputation on the imputation method in order to imputate with random values (truncated log distribution) instead of LOD/sqrt(2). If the user imputes the LOD missings, the dataset will be imputed and the user will not need to reimport it, the loaded dataset will be updated to have the LOD missings imputed, this can be checked by clicking on the ! symbol at the top bar of the application. 5.1.2 Missing imputation Once the dataset is loaded into the Shiny, look at the Missing Data tab to check the percentages of missing data for each exposure present. To impute the missing values select Impute missing values using mice (Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations), no other method of imputation is available in the software at the moment. After the process finishes, the expect output should be a new missing data graph where theres no missing of any exposure. The new imputed exposures set can be downloaded as a *.csv file, please note that the downloaded file just assigns numbers to the idnum column, if the data you are using has different idnum format its needed to format it properly so that it matches the idnum on the phenotypes input file when inputting it to the Shiny. 5.1.3 Exposures description Theres the option of visualizing the main descriptive stats of the exposures dataset, available for quantitative exposure varibables. The descriptive stats (per exposure) included on the table are: Number of values Number of NULLs Number of NAs Minimum Maximum Range of values Sum of values Median Mean Standard Error of mean 0.95 confidence interval of the mean Variance Standard deviation Variance coefficient This table will have the descriptive stats of the loaded dataset, this means that if the user has imputed the missings (remember that after imputing the missings, the imputed dataset becomes active) it will be reflected on the table as it will show 0 NAs. 5.1.4 Normality correction Once the dataset is loaded into the Shiny, look at the Check Normality tab to check which exposures are not normal (Normality = false), this are the results of ShapiroWilk testing. By selecting from the table the desired exposure and clicking the Plot histogram of selected exposure, as the label of the button implies, a histogram of the selected exposure from the table can be seen. There is also the option of visualizing the histogram for the implemented transformations along the normality test p-value for said transformations. By clicking the Show false button, all the non normal exposures are listed with the method that will be applied to normalize, this table can be edited (the Normalization method column) by double clicking on the desired row. There are three possible methods to use, log (default, natural logarithm), ^1/3 and sqrt. If no method is desired to be applied to an exposure (keep the original variable) input none. The normalization method refers to applying X function to a column of the exposures tables, to transform it. Click Normalize and the normalization method selected will be applied, the table on the Check Normality tab will be updated with the results of the normalization. 5.1.5 Exposures description To see all the insights of the exposures dataset loaded into the Shiny, once loaded it check the exposures description tab, there are three options to dig into the dataset, the family (family of the exposure) to visualize and two grouping factors (phenotypes). 5.1.6 PCA Analysis To see the results of a PCA (principal component analysis) study, load the data and check the PCA Visualization tab, there a set and grouping factor can be choose, its important noting (as its already stated on the Shiny) that the grouping parameter only works when the set is selected to samples. There are also selectors to choose which principal component to visualize on each axis, 10 principal components are computed. If the association of the PCA analysis with the exposures is desired to visualize, check the PCA association with exposures tab, there are two grouping methods to visualize, the phenotypes to principal components and the exposures to principal components. By clicking on Visualize as table, the table corresponding to the selected association will be prompted on a pop-up window, this table can be downloaded as a csv. 5.1.7 Clusterization and correlation of exposures Displaying the correlation of the exposures can help to visualize intra and inter family relations between the exposures, for that reason there are two different visualization options, the circos and the matrix. The clusterization of exposures uses a hierarchical clustering algorithm to classify the individuals profiles of exposures in k groups, where k can be selected by the user. The plot shows the profile for each group of individuals. To see the results of the exposure correlation and clustering, select the corresponding tab to each analysis. For the exposure correlation analysis there are two visualizations, the matrix representation and the circos. The correlation uses Pearson method for numerical-to-numerical correlation, Cramers V for categorical-to-categorical correlation and linear models for categorical-to-numerical. 5.1.8 ExWAS To perform an ExWAS (exposome-wide association, univariate test of the association between exposures and health outcomes using generalized linear models) study, check the ExWAS tab and select the addecuate parameters for the ExWAS plot, there are two different plot representations, the output variable to choose (phenotype), the output family and as many covariables (phenotypes) as the user wants. There are internal checks to advise the user on which parameters to select depending if the selected outcome is numerical or bionomial. 5.1.9 ExWAS - CTDquerier The ExWAS tab also is able to perform a CTD query of the desired chemicals. To perform a CTDquerier of chemicals with the results of the ExWAS, click on the desired exposure to preload it into the query, when clicked, a chemical name with its associated P-Value will appear on the table on the right, if thats the desired chemical to add to the query list click Add to querier. In the case of adding an unwanted chemical to the query list, select it (or them) by clicking on the Querier list and click on Remove from querier. To do the query of the chemicals to de CTD database click on Query on the CTD gene database and see the results on the Chemical CTDquerier Results subtab. Its important noting that on the Kegg pathways and Go terms the input field corresponds to the negative exponent of the filter. 5.1.10 Multivariate ExWAS Multivariate analysis using Elastic Net (LASSO regression). Multivariate ExWAS applies elastic net to the exposures given a health outcome of interest. The heat map is coloured with the coefficient of each exposure in relation with the health outcome, so the ones in white are not interesting. The two columns of the heat map correspond to the minimum lambda (Min) and to the lambda which gives the most regularised model such that error is within one standard error of the minimum (1SE). To perform a multivariate ExWAS study, check the Multivariate ExWAS tab and select the desired output parameter, click on run model to generate the plot. As on the ExWAS plot options theres implemented an internal check to advise the user on which parameters to select depending if the selected outcome is numerical or bionomial, as the diagrams states if the dataset has not been imputed the missings, it will automatically do it to perform the Multivariate ExWAS, however when closing the plot the imputed dataset will be removed from the environment, so all the other studies performed afterwards will not be altered. 5.2 Exposome-Omic analysis Its important noting that the maximum size of the omics data is 30 MB, if the omics file to be analyzed is bigger, change the line number 2 of the server.R file. # the &quot;30&quot; refers to 30MB, change as needed options(shiny.maxRequestSize=30*1024^2) 5.2.1 Association analysis Do first the proceeding of exposome data load and corresponding treatment if desired, then proceed to load the omic dataset on the Data Entry subtab. The omic data should be provided as a *.RData file. The exposome dataset can be subseted by families for this analysis, on the Exposome subsetting subtab select the families that are desired to be included in this new set to study, if all the families are desired just dont input any and proceed to click the Subset and add, which will trigger the action to combine the subsetted (or not) exposome dataset with the provided omic dataset. Select the variables for the association analysis (linear models) and if SVA (surrogate variable analysis) is wanted on the Association model subtab. There are tabs to visualize the results of running the association model, all of the are on the Model visualization subtab. The Results table shows the gene, log of the fold change, p-value and adjusted p-value. The Significant hits shows the exposure, hits and lambda. The QQ Plot shows a QQ plot (expected vs. observed -lo10(p-value)) for the selected exposure. The Volcan plot shows a volcan plot (log2(fold change) vs -log10(p-value)). For this plot there are two input cells to adjust the horizontal and verital limit lines to filter out the results. 5.2.2 CTD querier To perform a CTD querier study of the exposome-omic analysis, as before, load both datasets and run the desired model with them, check the Volcan plot and click on the desired point on the Volcan plot, the information of the selected plot will appear on the table below the plot (sometimes there are many points close so more than one rows can appear on the table), select from the table the desired point to add to the query and click Add to querier. Its important noting that when trying to add to the querier the Shiny will find on the fields of the omic dataset that the user specifies on top of the plot. If the search does not return any symbol a prompt will appear, however if its found it will be added to the lower table corresponding to the genes to query. If by mistake some gene (or genes) were introduced to the querier, select them by clicking on the table row and click Remove from querier. Click on Query selected genes on the CTD gene database to perform the query of all the symbols of the querier list. To visualize the results of the query, go to the CTDquerier results subtab. There are six tabs showing different results interpretations. First theres the Lost &amp; found tab which a plot to see the amount of genes found on the CTD database and the ones that were not found them, thers also two lists stating the names of them. The diseases tab shows a table of all the associated diseases found on the CTD database. The curated diseases tab shows the table of associated diseases but only shows the ones with direct evidence. The association tab shows information about all the direct evidence associated diseases. Select the disease of interest to see the score and reference count of it. The inference score tab shows the inference score for each gene for a selected disease, the filter parameters puts out the genes with an inference score lower than the selected filter. The association matrix tab shows a matrix of genes vs. chemicals with a heatmap representing the existing papers (references) providing evidence about the association between chemicals and genes.
