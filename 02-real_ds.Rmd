# Data sets

## Exposome dataset
The exposome is composed of three different files (in `*.csv` format). Those files are refered inside the Shiny as exposures, description and phenotypes. Their content is the following:

+ The `exposures` file contains the measures of each exposure for all the individuals included on the analysis. It is a matrix-like file having a row per individual and a column per exposures. It must includes a column with the subject’s identifier.
+ The `description` file contains a row for each exposure and, at last, defined the families of exposures. Usually, this file incorporates a description of the exposures, the matrix where it was obtained and the units of measurement among others.
+ The `phenotypes` file contains the covariates to be included in the analysis as well as the health outcomes of interest. It contains a row per individual included in the analysis and a column for each covariate and outcome. Moreover, it must include a column with the individual’s identifier.

A visual representation of the three matrices and how they correlate is the following.

Phenotypes data file example:

sub01 control  23.2539  boy  4    ...
sub02 asthma   24.4498  girl 5    ...
sub03 asthma   15.2356  boy  4    ...

sub05 control  22.0477  boy  5    ...
...   ...      ...      ...  ...
```

## Plain datasets

If the researcher has gathered all the data on a single file which contains both phenotype and exposure data, this file can be used too. The user interface has a selector for it, more information on the [correspondent section](#plain_data).

## Omics dataset {#omicsds}

The omics data inputed to the Shiny must be provided as an `*.RData`. This file has to contain an ExpressionSet, which is an S4 object. This object is a data container of the Bioconductor toolset.

For further information on ExpressionSet and how to create and manipulate them, please visit the [official documentation](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/Biobase/inst/doc/ExpressionSetIntroduction.pdf) and this [ selected vignette](https://kasperdanielhansen.github.io/genbioconductor/html/ExpressionSet.html).
